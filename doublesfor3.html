Here is a variation that makes it easier for the singles player to win a game.<UL><LI> One player serves, and defends the singles sidelines.<LI> Two players receive, and defend the doubles sidelines.<LI> Each "game" is a 7-point tie-breaker (first to 7 points, win by 2).<LI> ALL the serves are "no fault" -- the singles player keeps serving each point of the tie-break until a ball goes in.<LI> The "doubles" players BOTH stay behind the baseline until the serve bounces.<LI> If the single player wins, he/she gets 2 "games"; otherwise the doubles players get 1 "game" each.<LI> Rotate serving every tie-break.<LI> First person to collect 6 games and be ahead of the other players by more than 1 game wins a set.<LI> The first person to win 2 sets wins the match.</UL>Or, just make up your own variation.<P><a href="http://tennisclub.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Goddard Tennis Club</a><P></BODY></HTML>
