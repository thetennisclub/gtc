<LI> Pain reliever: Ibuprofen (Advil or Nuprin) has proven the best for relieving muscle soreness, but it can cause stomach problems. If you have a tender tummy, try acetaminophen (Tylenol). It also can relieve pain and generally is tolerated better.
<LI> Sports cream: Keep products such as Mineral Ice or Ben-Gay on hand to help ease the pain of a muscle injury. But don't get lulled into thinking you can use it for relief every time. Try to determine what part of your game is causing repetitive soreness and change it.
<LI> Adhesive tape: White medical tape such as Johnson & Johnson Athletic Tape can be used to wrap a joint before playing. Put Johnson & Johnson Pre-Wrap under the tape to keep it from tearing at the skin. Taping an ankle, for example, is a common way to prevent injuries or to reduce stress to a healing sprain.
<LI> Foot products: Your feet take a real beating in tennis. Calluses, corns and blisters are common because of the sudden changes in direction. Doughnut-shaped products such as Dr. Scholl's corn cushions can provide relief. Try using flexible fabric Band-Aids or 3M Active Strips for blister prevention, but one step better is moleskin or New-skin which you stick directly on the hot spot before play.
<LI> Athlete's foot powder: You also might keep anti-fungal sprays or creams in your medicine chest since sweaty sneakers often cause outbreaks of athlete's foot. Lotrimin AF is a popular choice.
<LI> Talcum powder: Absorbant talc, such as Johnson's baby powder, is terrific for soaking up sweat and cutting down on friction in your shoes. Try some in between two pairs of socks if you get blisters often.
<LI> Sandwich bags and elastic bandage: Zipper bags are convenient for making ice packs. Once you've made an ice pack, wrap it in place using an Ace bandage. This way you get compression and ice.
<LI> Anti-bacterial product: Scrapes and cuts should first be cleaned with warm soapy water. Then apply a cream or spray such as Bacitracin, Neosporin or Bactine and a clean bandage that's large enough to cover the area. Change the dressing once or twice a day, or whenever it gets wet.
<LI> Hydrocortisone cream: Insect bites and rashes may be part of your game on outdoor courts. Cortaid will help.
<LI> Sunburn cream: If you miss a spot with your sunscreen, try an apres-sun cream with aloe such as Coppertone's After Sun.
