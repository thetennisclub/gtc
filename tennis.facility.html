</h2>
The Goddard Tennis Club's members pay dues and donate their time and effort to build and maintain the facilities. <br>
<a href="http://gewa.gsfc.nasa.gov/">GEWA</a> facilities are <em>NOT</em> government supplied, but come out of membership dues, vending machine fees, and volunteer construction.  
<p>
Since 1966, the club members have constructed:
<p>
<center>
<img src="./images/hartru.jpg" alt="hartru courts"><br>
<font size=6><b>Eight <a href="http://www.httennis.com/">Har-Tru</a> courts</b></font>

<h2>

<a name="procedures">PROCEDURES</a>
</h2>
Playing season on the Har-Tru clay courts is limited to April-October by the frost-freeze cycle. 
The hard courts #9 and #10 are open all year. 
All courts are used on a first-come basis, but with a 1.0 hour limit if people are waiting.  
<p>
The courts are policed occasionally by the club members, who can ask non-members to leave or be escorted off the courts by GSFC security (dial 301-286-8661 from any cellular telephone). 
<p>
Hard court #9 has an electrical outlet that can be used to power the ball machine, which may be used for solo practice whenever two members are not waiting to play. 
Hard court #10 has a practice wall, which may be used for solo practice whenever two members are not waiting to play. 

<!-- 
<p>
Six of the courts (#1-4, 8 and 9) can be reserved in advance on a sign-up sheet on a clipboard at court side.  One sign-up sheet per day is posted for the next few weeks, marked off in 1.5 hour slots, with starting times staggered every 15 minutes.  The right to sign up a slot is an option in the annual membership fee.  Members can buy one or two sign-up privileges.  Each sign-up slot must show two members names, both with sign-up privileges.  The sign-up sheet is policed occasionally by the club officials, who cross off illegal sign-ups and talk to the offenders.  
<p>
The other four courts (#5-7 and 10) are used on a first-come basis, but with a 1.0 hour limit if people are waiting.  Walk-ons must write down their time on a lucite board with a grease pencil at the gate, and post their membership cards.  If they don't write down a start time or post their cards, they can be booted at any time by other members who do play be the rules.

BALL MACHINE
</h2>
The Club has a small <a href="http://www.sportstutor.com/tennis/prolite/">Tennis Tutor ProLite Plus AC</a> ball machine purchased in 2014, replacing a broken Prolite purchased in 2005, which replaced a worn-out Prince machine purchased in 1990.  It can be used for practice on court 9, a hard court where there are electrical outlets.  
<!-- 
Court 9 can be reserved for practice, if you have purchased a reservation privilege. 
 -->
<p>
The machine throws balls at the speed of a ground stroke, and can be adjusted for speed, height, topspin, and a side-to-side oscillating motion.  It holds about 60 balls.  The Club supplies a bucket of long-lived pressureless practice balls.  You can buy your own bucket from mail-order suppliers like <a href="http://www.holabirdsports.com/">Holabird Sports in Baltimore</a>.  
<br>
<img src="./images/prolite-plus-panel.jpg" border=0 alt="panel">
<br>
When invoking topspin, turn up the ball speed knob to get sufficient depth. 
<p>
The Club's ball machine is stored in a locked shed just outside court 9.  Access to the machine (a key to the lock) can be purchased from the Club as a <a href="./tennisclub.html#membership">annual membership option</a>.   It is a good idea to have somebody show you how to use the machine, the first time.
