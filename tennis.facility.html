One sign-up sheet per day is posted for the next few weeks, marked off in 1.5 hour slots, with starting times staggered every 15 minutes.  The right to sign up a slot is an option in the annual membership fee.  Members can buy one or two sign-up privileges.  Each sign-up slot must show two members names, both with sign-up privileges.  The sign-up sheet is policed occasionally by the club officials, who cross off illegal sign-ups and talk to the offenders.  <p>The other four courts (#5-7 and 10) are used on a first-come basis, but with a 1.0 hour limit if people are waiting.  Walk-ons must write down their time on a lucite board with a grease pencil at the gate, and post their membership cards.  If they don't write down a start time or post their cards, they can be booted at any time by other members who do play be the rules.  <p> --><p><hr> <h2><img src="./images/player8.jpg" border=0 alt="player">BALL MACHINE</h2>The Club has a small <a href="http://www.sportstutor.com/tennis/prolite/">Tennis Tutor ProLite Plus AC</a> ball machine purchased in 2014, replacing a broken Prolite purchased in 2005, which replaced a worn-out Prince machine purchased in 1990.  It can be used for practice on court 9, a hard court where there are electrical outlets.  <!-- Court 9 can be reserved for practice, if you have purchased a reservation privilege.  --><p>The machine throws balls at the speed of a ground stroke, and can be adjusted for speed, height, topspin, and a side-to-side oscillating motion.  It holds about 60 balls.  The Club supplies a bucket of long-lived pressureless practice balls.  You can buy your own bucket from mail-order suppliers like <a href="http://www.holabirdsports.com/">Holabird Sports in Baltimore</a>.  <br><img src="./images/prolite-plus-panel.jpg" border=0 alt="panel"><br>When invoking topspin, turn up the ball speed knob to get sufficient depth. <p>The Club's ball machine is stored in a locked shed just outside court 9.  Access to the machine (a key to the lock) can be purchased from the Club as a <a href="./tennisclub.html#membership">annual membership option</a>.   It is a good idea to have somebody show you how to use the machine, the first time.  <p><hr><h2><img src="./images/man_teaching_woman_tennis_backhand_1912.jpg" alt="teaching backhand" width="136" height="200"> <a name="history">GTC HISTORY</a></h2><a href="./GTCat25.pdf"> <img src="./images/pdf.icon.gif" alt="PDF icon" border=0> In 1991, a brief 25-year history of the founding of the Goddard Tennis Club was presented by the court architect and first president, Bob Davis. <br>(We only have a copy of his typed notes scanned into a PDF file.) <img src="./images/pdf.icon.gif" alt="PDF icon" border=0></a><p>You can find Bob Davis on-line (as of March 2012) at <a href="http://www.bobdavis.usptapro.com/">http://www.bobdavis.usptapro.com/</a><hr><h2><a href="./GTC_maintenance.html"><img src="./images/shhammer.gif" border=0 alt="under construction">GTC MAINTENANCE NOTES ...another page--></a></h2><hr><h2><a href="./GTC_emergency_map.pdf"><img src="./GTC_maintenance/hazmatball.png" border=0 alt="hazmat ball"> Emergency cut-offs (click for miniposter)</a></h2><ul>  <li>Electricity - behind the auto club.  <li>Sprinklers - at the fireplug by the road-gate.  <li>Water Fountains - on the Rec Center, along the wooden path to the far storage shed.</ul><hr><h3><a href="./tennisclub.html"><img src="./images/tennisball.gif" border=0 alt="tennis ball">Return to the GTC Home Page</a></h3><hr>The Goddard Tennis Club (GTC) is a member of the <a name="gewa" href="http://gewa.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Goddard Employees Welfare Association (GEWA)</a>, a collection of <a href="http://gewa.gsfc.nasa.gov/clubs/">mutual-interest clubs and services</a> run by the workers at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/goddard/">NASA-GSFC</a>.<p></body></html>
