The Goddard Tennis Club (GTC) will host a singles tournament over the Memorial Day Holiday weekend. 
All levels of ability are welcome. 

The GTC tournament is a "Swiss-style" round-robin:
winners-play-winners and non-winners-play-non-winners every round, 
so eventually everybody plays opponents close to their own ability. 
All Goddard and affiliate (badged) employees and their families are welcome to participate. 

The cost is $5, to cover trophies and refreshments, 
payable before the start of play at 9 am at the Goddard courts.

Please express your interest in participating by registering IN ADVANCE 
via an email to <a href="mailto:anegri@umd.edu">anegri@umd.edu</a> by May 21. 

Participation will be limited to the first 20 registrants. 
Day-of registration cannot be accommodated.

The GTC tournaments are Swiss-style round-robin: winners-play-winners and losers-play-losers every round, so everybody eventually plays opponents on their own level.  
<p>
The tournaments are usually open to anyone qualified to play on the GTC courts: members, family members, and guests. 
</p><p>
Tournament play counts as a ladder match, unless one of the players explicitly says "no" before the tournament match begins. 
</p><p>
At the discretion of the ladder chairman, ladder members playing in and completing the GTC singles tournaments are promoted to the top of the ladder, in the order that they finish in the tournament.  Ladder members who receive this promotion are subject to unrestricted challenges for the next 4 weeks. 
</p><p>
Tournament registration is on a sheet posted at courtside a few weeks before the tournament, or via phone or e-mail to the tournament director. 
</p><p>
The tournament director is responsible for seeding, based on ladder standings and best judgement of skill.  Please don't argue with him/her/it.

Andy Negri, UMd/ESSIC, is the tournament director [<a href="mailto:anegri@umd.edu">anegri@umd.edu</a>].

Greetings Tennis Fans!
 
Thanks to all who came to the Tennis Social!  I hope you all had a good time and
met some new players.  To those who missed it, we’ll be sure to organize another
fun event soon!  I got some great feedback that I hope to implement in the
coming season.
 
First, there was a lot of interest in starting an email list to find people to
play with outside the competitive tennis ladder.  So, we’ve started a new
mailing list.  If you’re interested in receiving requests and announcements for
when people need subs or just want to hit around on the courts, go to:
https://lists.nasa.gov/mailman/listinfo/gsfc-tennis-any-one
and subscribe. 
We’re keeping it a separate list so that the club news (this mailing list you’re
receiving now) doesn’t get inundated with other traffic.
 
Second, We had a lot of new interest from beginners, or folks who haven’t picked
up a racket in a while.  So, I’d like to organize a time, one day a week, that
we’ll call a “Beginners Workshop”.  This will be a time when beginners can feel
comfortable to come out and just hit around with others at their level.
Occasionally we’ll get the ball machine set up, and have some structured
lessons/ drills.  If you’re interested, email me at erin.wilson@nasa.gov with a
preferred day/time of the week and I’ll try to set up something that accomodates
everyone.
 
Don’t forget we’re laying down the final layer of har-tru on court 1 this
afternoon 4:30-5:30.  Stop by if you have a minute to help brush!  And Wednesday
we need LOTS of help at lunch to lay down the lines.   
 
And lastly, if you haven’t already, please get your 2012 membership forms and
dues to Michael Powers (B19, Rm S004) soon!  The form is attached and can also
be found on the club website: http:/tennisclub.gsfc.nasa.gov
 
Thanks!
Erin

     	Goddard Tennis Club Meeting Notes, March 23, 2015, 12 noon

	1.	Overview of the Goddard Tennis Club (GTC) facility and location was
	provided for new people on Center to become familiar with the club.   The
	Har-tru courts are open.  There will be some periodic closures when some
	of the court maintenance is done later in the season. The GTC website has
	the Ladder information and a Casual Play list.   Members are encouraged
	to sign up for the casual play list which has dwindled.   Ladder sign up
	is on the Membership form.  

	2.	There was no response from the previous email request for
	nominations of Officers.   There was a call at the meeting for Officers
	(President, Vice President, and Secretary) with no candidates or
	nominations from the floor.  Joe Miko agreed to be Vice President,
	replacing Mike Powers.  Many thanks for many years of service as a GTC
	officer as Treasurer and Vice President.  Other Officers remain:  Maria
	Lecha, President; Andy Negri, Treasurer; and Secretary, Vacant.  

	3.	Plans for Tennis Lessons at lunchtime are in work by George
	Kallarakal and Long Pham.   Info will be sent to the tennis club email
	list and probably notices submitted in Goddard Dateline.  From previous
	years, no one has volunteered to teach lessons after work.

	4.	Tournaments/Activities – Andy Negri is organizing the Singles
	Tournaments for Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends.   These are Swiss
	style tournaments where one gets to play at least four rounds (win or
	lose).  The spring tournament is a good way for new people to meet other
	members of the club.   Notices will be sent to the tennis club email list
	and also on Goddard Dateline.   If anyone else is interested in running
	an additional Tournament or an Open House or any other activity, please
	submit a draft plan to the Officers.  

	5.	The Membership Form will be updated for the 2016 Season.

	6.	There was interest in having a reduced rate for possible new
	members to try out the club by playing for a few times from Cliff Liu.  
	The membership is mostly not checked on the courts for the early part of
	season, possibly for the month of April or so, so actually people can try
	out the club during this time and actually a few people do this every
	year.  An advertised campaign was suggested.  Martin Perrine will draft
	up a notice for Dateline for the Officers and lead the initiative.  

	7.	There was a possibility to coordinate some access to the courts
	with the NASA “MOVE” fitness program.  

	8.	The budget was reviewed.   A list of repairs and replacement of
	equipment and facilities improvements was shown and will be looked at for
	prioritization.  Dan Mandl suggested to continue to defer large project
	work on the hard courts and extend their life with continued smaller
	projects.  Dan Mandl will submit more information on his suggestions.  A
	capital reserve type listing on the budget will be considered to be shown
	for larger expenditures.  Expenses were lowered several years ago mostly
	by Dennis Chesters picking up when the previous Maintenance Person moved
	out of the area.  GEWA stopped providing funds for maintenance about the
	same time frame.   GEWA provided limited grants and loans to clubs last
	year after many years of not doing so.  The Tennis Club’s request to GEWA
	last year was denied.  Dan Mandl mentioned the aging of the structural
	portion of the lights on the hard courts.   A past member who had worked
	on the lights a few years ago has also moved out of the area about 2
	years ago.  His parting recommendation to the club was rust removal and
	painting of the scaffold that is needed to work on the lights – which has
	not been done.  A club member or members could volunteer to investigate
	alternatives for restoration/repair/replacements of lights, as well as
	the scaffold work.  Har-tru topping is needed this year for most of the
	Har-tru courts.  

	9.	Bob Davis, the main Goddard Tennis Club founder, presented some
	info on his latest activities and awards as well as background on the
	development of the Goddard Tennis Club.   Learn about the history of the
	club.  A scan of a 1991 presentation is on the Tennis Club Web Site. 
	Near the bottom of the club facility tab of the webpage.   The club was
	built and has been maintained by club members.
